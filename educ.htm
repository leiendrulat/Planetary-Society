    <h2>Astronomy</h2>
    <br>
    <p><b>Astronomy,</b> science that encompasses the study of all extraterrestrial objects and phenomena. Until the
      invention of the telescope and the discovery of the laws of motion and gravity in the 17th century, astronomy was
      primarily concerned with noting and predicting the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets, originally for
      calendrical and astrological purposes and later for navigational uses and scientific interest. The catalog of
      objects now studied is much broader and includes, in order of increasing distance, the solar system, the stars
      that make up the Milky Way Galaxy, and other, more distant galaxies. With the advent of scientific space probes,
      Earth also has come to be studied as one of the planets, though its more-detailed investigation remains the domain
      of the Earth sciences.</p>
    <h2>The Solar System</h2>
    <br>
    <p><b>The Solar System</b> is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either
      directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the
      remainder being smaller objects, such as the five dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.</p>
    <p>In the 17th century, Galileo discovered that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four
      satellites in orbit around it.Christiaan Huygens followed on from Galileo's discoveries by discovering Saturn's
      moon Titan and the shape of the rings of Saturn.Edmond Halley realised in 1705 that repeated sightings of a comet
      were recording the same object, returning regularly once every 75–76 years. This was the first evidence that
      anything other than the planets orbited the Sun. Around this time (1704), the term "Solar System" first appeared
      in English. In 1838, Friedrich Bessel successfully measured a stellar parallax, an apparent shift in the position
      of a star created by Earth's motion around the Sun, providing the first direct, experimental proof of
      heliocentrism. Improvements in observational astronomy and the use of unmanned spacecraft have since enabled the
      detailed investigation of other bodies orbiting the Sun.</p>

    <h2>Constellations</h2>
    <br>
    <p><b>Constellation,</b> in astronomy, any of certain groupings of stars that were imagined—at least by those who
      named them—to form conspicuous configurations of objects or creatures in the sky. Constellations are useful in
      tracking artificial satellites and in assisting astronomers and navigators to locate certain stars.</p>
    <p>Stars move across the sky on a regular schedule, much like the sun. At various times of year, different
      constellations appear at sunset. The rising constellations rotate based on the Earth's path through space, and so
      can be used to mark the seasons in regions when moderate weather may not convey the change between winter and
      spring.</p>

    <h2>Comets and Asteroids</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Asteroids and comets are considered remnants from the giant cloud of gas and dust that condensed to create the
      sun, planets, and moons some 4.5 billion years ago. Today, most asteroids orbit the sun in a tightly packed belt
      located between Mars and Jupiter.</p>

    <h2>Famous Astronomers</h2>
    <h3>Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543)</h3>
    <p>Famous For: Formulating the heliocentric illustration of the universe
      The “heliocentric theory” of Copernicus can be found in On the Revolutions of Celestial Spheres. The theory
      presented the argument that the earth is not the center of the universe, and presented that the Sun directly
      affects the movement of the planets.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Galileo Galilei (1564–1642)</h3>
    <p>Famous For: Being the “Father of Observational Astronomy”
      As the father of observational astronomy, Galileo identified the four moons of Jupiter, observed and provided an
      analysis of sunspots, and presenting the theory of heliocentrism.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Johann Gottfried Galle (1812–1910)</h3>
    <p>Famous For: Discovering the planet Neptune
      While working at the Berlin Observatory, Galle first observed and viewed Neptune, the eighth planet from the sun.
      Later in his life, he provided methods to calculate planetary orbits</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Stephen Hawking (1942)</h3>
    <p>Famous For: The “Hawking radiation theory”
      Using quantum mechanics and the general theory of relativity, he combined the two fields of study to explain
      cosmology. He also proposed that “black holes” produce radiation, this radiation from the black holes is known as
      “Hawking radiation.”</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Famous Telescopes and Radios</h2>
    <h3>Gemini Observatory</h3>
    <p>Two eyes are better than one. The Gemini Observatory's twin optical/infrared telescopes are an ocean apart, yet
      together they can access the entire sky. Gemini South is located at almost 9,000 feet in the Chilean Andes; Gemini
      North (pictured) sits atop the dormant volcano Mauna Kea, home to an international community of telescopes peering
      at the night skies through Hawaii's excellent atmosphere. Seven countries own Gemini, whose scientists make it a
      point to keep the telescope's technology fresh -- the observatories even have a "sputtering chamber" that applies
      silver coatings on the Gemini mirrors to increase their infrared capabilities.courtesy Gemini</p>

    <h3>European Southern Observatory</h3>
    <p>The observatory's 3.5-meter scope, the dryly named New Technology Telescope, was the first telescope in the world
      to have a computer-controlled main mirror. Even amateur scopes now have that technology. The ESO's suite of
      telescopes in Chile's Atacama Desert also includes the Very Large Telescope array (pictured), Europe's flagship
      observatory. The ESO is also home to Europe's portion of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-Millimeter Array, known
      as ALMA, an intercontinental collaboration with North America, east Asia and Chile. ALMA will be the highest
      observatory on Earth and the world's most advanced radio astronomy observatory. Which takes us to the next top
      observatory ...courtesy ESO</p>

    <br>
    <h3>National Radio Astronomy Observatory</h3>
    <p>The observatory's several sites include the Green Bank Telescope, the Very Large Array (pictured), the Very Large
      Baseline Array and the future U.S. portion of ALMA. Scientists have recently used data from Green Bank to search
      for the frequencies of molecules in interstellar space. The Very Large Array's boring name belies its stupendous
      size: it consists of 27 radio antennas, each weighing 230 tons and reaching 82 feet in diameter. The array, in the
      desert south of Socorro, New Mexico, combines to give the resolution of a 22-mile-wide antenna. Some people might
      recognize it from the movie Contact.courtesy NRAO</p>
